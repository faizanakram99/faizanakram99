# Hi, I'm Faizan 👋

Software engineer with nearly a decade of experience building backend systems. Currently based in the Netherlands, working on a multi-tenant ERP software specialized in commodity trading.

## What I Do

I build backend systems primarily with **PHP (Symfony)** and **MySQL**. I use **Pulumi** for cloud infrastructure and **Ansible** for bare metal. I also handle monitoring and deployments, and keep production systems running.

For the frontend, I prefer **vanilla JavaScript** and **HTMX**, and use **React** and **TypeScript** when needed.

## When Not Coding

When not coding, I like to play with my toddlers, travel, and sleep.
